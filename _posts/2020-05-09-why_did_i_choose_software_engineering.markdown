Well let me first introduce myself. My name is Jackson Ramos, currently I live in Long Island, New York. I graduated highschool in 2013 with the hopes of becoming a computer science major. However, my girlfriend at the time convinced to go into med school so i did pre med for a while. That was until i had my first of a Bi-Polar episode. I dropped out of school with about 58 credits(yes i know, about 6 credits away from an associates degree). For the next couple of years i had no choice but to focus on my mental stability, dealing with some really highs(mania) and lows(depression). That being said I was in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about 4 years. It became really difficult for me to work, go into school, or even just being at home. I was really into sports and fitness,as well as anything artistic. Of course with being on medication and being on trail and error to find a medicine that fit with my biology, I became overweight and had a dullness/numb feelings toward all the art that used to make me feel like i was on the purest ecstacy man can find. This is when i almost commited suicide and put in the ICU for about a week by overdosing on my anti-depresants and mood stabilizers. Of course i am here today which means i was unsuccessful. And was my last time in a psych as the perefect med that fit me was found. At first my family really frowned upon my mental illness and had a sort of stigma towards me. But after time they became very understanding and when I found the chance, with this quarantine, to get back into school... At first i wanted to go back into an art field whether it be visual art, theater, music etc. I wanted to be able to express myself again, especially be able to express my darkest feelings that i've had over the years and feed it with creativity. Of course my way of expressing became very obessessive and very synonymous with  the characters in theses songs:

Guess what i chose. 
				 
**Why Software Engineering?**

So growing up i became pretty savvy with computers. I ended up building my own. Throughout my educative experience i was always top of my classes in pretty much every subject, especially math (I ended up taking AP Calculus and AP Physics in highschool). My parents always pushed me to take a rather logical approach towards things. It's not that they didn't support my creativity aspect, just that they wanted to see me have an assured success. With that, after my mental state became very healthy and stable, I needed to have some sort of structure in my life, being either structured tasks, jobs and ideas. Where even in this field, abstraction is very structured. I wanted a career where i can enjoy the work I do in a relaxed environment and of course being surrounded by such positive people helps so much to build my confidence even more. Pretty much chasing the idea that if someone can be successful and happy in something that may seem difficult, why can't I? Also, i needed something that would help me supplement my goals on chasing a creative field whether it be by school or even at home on my free time. Don't get me wrong it would be great to do that now, but I want to find my own financial freedom so i can chase my dreams even more and not have to depend on someone else when i want a plate of food. It also helps that throughout this journey i've found my spiritual side.
